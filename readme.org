#+TITLE: Custom org link types for local libraries

Collection of org link libraries that provide type links for various
types of documents.

I call each library =ol-library-[type]=. Libraries are filesystem
collections of files that one can cross-ref by use of links.

The benefit of this library is that one can ocnfigure emacs so that it
knows of the location of these libraries throughout and, thus, won't
have to dabble with attachments to org mode documents.
